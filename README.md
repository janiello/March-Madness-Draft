# March-Madness-Draft
 
About Alleyoop
 
This app has been months in the making. All great ideas begin simply-- with a problem.
 
Facebook’s newsfeed, revolutionary for its time, began with the concept of a butler bringing you the gossip of the day. From a problem -- isolation among technies probably crammed into some basement forced to listen to Mark Zuckerburg all day -- came innovation. From that ‘push’ grew Facebook’s own monolithic program that some news outlets say threaten liberty and democracy itself.
 
But Joe’s problem began simply. He and his friends from college, made distant by time and fate, all coming together to fantasize about basketball.
 
He dreamed beyond Microsoft spreadsheets, to envision a program that would enable him and his friends to come together -- if only electronically -- every year for their beloved sport. The only problem: he couldn’t code.
 
He joined a coding bootcamp, and this became his coding bootcamp swan song.
