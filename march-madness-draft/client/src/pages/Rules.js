            <p>Sixty-four teams, four regions, six rounds, one winner.
            <br/><br/>
            Our game has all the thrills of fantasy basketball-- chance, skill, luck, and loss.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h1>The Rules</h1>

            <p>Each player chooses eight teams to root for, following their progression through the completion of the tournament. Whatever criteria you use to select your eight teams are entirely your own -- whether you choose your teams based on skill, luck, or loyalty just may be the difference between victory or defeat.
            <br/><br/>
            Each team you choose has a corresponding seed number, which is a number generated through an approximation of factors, including the teamâ€™s skill, players, and past performances. With each win, as your team(s) progresses into a new round, their seed number compounds and gets added to your individual user score.
            <br/><br/>
            Note: Even if your team does not win the final championship, the victor of this fantasy is he or she who holds the highest score, or accumulation of seed scores.
            <br/><br/>
            Good luck!
            </p>
